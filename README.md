# Overview

Hello everyone and welcome to my project file! This was a project I have been wanting to make for awhile and it is finally here. This project is an amazon scrapper that actively checks for prices on amazon daily and if your product(s) are the price you want, it will send an email to you with the link saying to buy now.

This project was a lot of fun to make and I learned a lot with Python but also with sending emails using python which ended up being a challenge in itself. Below you can find my youtube video explaining the project and code.

# Development Environment

For this project we used python and also a lot of libraries that were imported to the project. First of which was the "Requests" library which allows us to go in and take data from a website. Then from "Bs4" we imported "BeautifulSoup" Which with the help of requests allows us to pull individual items from a website. We also imported "smtplib" which is a mail protocol which simply just let's us send emails. And lastly we imported "time" which helped to make the program run daily.
